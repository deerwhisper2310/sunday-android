# ‚òÄÔ∏è Sun Day

## ‚ú® Project Overview


Sun Day is an open-source Android application designed to help you stay informed about the UV Index and optimize your Vitamin D production, all while minimizing sun exposure risks. Inspired by [its iOS counterpart](https://github.com/jackjackbits/sunday), Sun Day provides real-time UV data, personalized Vitamin D calculations, and adapts its interface dynamically to the time of day.

This project is being vibecoded via [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose), mainly with Gemini 2.5 Pro.

This is the first Android app I've ever created so expect issues! Learning on the fly here :)
