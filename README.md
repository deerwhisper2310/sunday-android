# ☀️ Sunday

## ✨ Project Overview

Sunday is an open-source Android application designed to help you stay informed about the UV Index and optimize your Vitamin D production, all while minimizing sun exposure risks. Inspired by its iOS counterpart (https://github.com/jackjackbits/sunday), Sunday provides real-time UV data, personalized Vitamin D calculations, and adapts its interface dynamically to the time of day.

This project is being vibecoded via Goose (https://block.github.io/goose), mainly with Gemini 2.5 Pro.

This is the first Android app I've ever created so expect issues! Learning on the fly here :)
